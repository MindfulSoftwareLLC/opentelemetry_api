## Release Process

1. **Prepare Release**
   - [ ] Update version in `pubspec.yaml`
   - [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md with release date and changes
   - [ ] Create a git tag for the version (e.g., `git tag v0.8.0`)
   - [ ] Push the tag to the repository (`git push origin v0.8.0`)

2. **Publish to pub.dev**
   - [ ] Run final `dart pub publish --dry-run` check
   - [ ] Publish with `dart pub publish`
   - [ ] Verify package appears correctly on pub.dev

3. **Post-Release**
   - [ ] Create a GitHub release with release notes
   - [ ] Announce in appropriate channels (if applicable)
   - [ ] Update documentation website (if applicable)
   - [ ] Increment to next development version

## Emergency Fixes

If an emergency fix is required for a released version:

1. Create a hotfix branch from the tagged release
2. Make minimal required changes
3. Follow the standard release process but increment the PATCH version
4. Merge the fix back to the main branch if applicable

## CNCF Contribution Considerations

If preparing for CNCF contribution:

- [ ] Ensure all legal requirements are met (license, CLAs, etc.)
- [ ] Review contribution guidelines for the OpenTelemetry organization
- [ ] Prepare documentation specifically required for CNCF review
