[![OpenTelemetry API Specification](https://img.shields.io/badge/OpenTelemetry%20API-Specification-blueviolet)](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/)

A Dart implementation of the [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) API that strictly adheres to the 
OpenTelemetry (OTel) specification. This package provides a vendor-neutral, implementation-agnostic API for telemetry 
instrumentation in Dart applications.

## Overview

This OpenTelemetry API for Dart exists as a standalone library to strictly adhere to the OpenTelemetry specification 
which separates API and SDK concerns. The specification requires that the API can be dropped into an app without an SDK 
and it will work in a no-op fashion.

This API is rarely used without an SDK. The SDK for this API is implemented by 
`dartastic_opentelemetry`, the [Dartastic OTel SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/dartastic_opentelemetry).
To instrument Dart apps, include the latest `dartastic_opentelemetry` and use its `OTel` class.

To instrument Flutter applications use the [Flutterific OTel SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/flutterrific_opentelemetry), 
`flutterrific_opentelemetry` to gain almost automatic instrumentation for app routes, error catching 
and web vitals metrics and much more. Additional Flutterific OTel SDKs hook into popular Flutter libraries for state management, 
networking, logging, amongst others.

[Dartastic.io](https://dartastic.io) provides and OpenTelemetry Observability backend for Flutter apps, Dart backends and 
any other service or process that produces OpenTelemetry. Dartastic.io is an observability background built on 
open standards, catering specifically to Flutter and Dart applications with the ability to show Dart source code lines
and function calls from production errors and logs. Dartastic.io comes with a generous data parameters, various levels of free, paid and enterprise support and 
additional pro library features that are not available in the open source offering including telemetry 
that integrates with native code and Real-Time User Monitoring of Flutter apps, training and consulting. 

This `opentelemetry_api` OTel API for Dart exists as a standalone library to strictly adhere to the
OpenTelemetry specification which separates API and the SDK. The specification
requires that the API can be dropped into an app without an SDK and it will work in a no-op fashion. 
You could include just `opentelemetry_api` in your pubspec.yaml top get a no-op implementation
as required by the OTel specification, though this would be a rare use case. Typically, 
backend instrumenters will include `dartastic_opentelemetry` in their pubspec.yaml
and this opentelemetry_api will be a transitive dependency.  Flutter instrumentation developers 
will include `flutterrific_opentelemetry`.

Another direct use for this library is for developers who write instrumentation libraries.  
This OpenTelemetry API is pluggable. You can create your own `OTelFactory` to
implement your own SDK implementation.  See the Dartastic OTel SDK's `OTelSDKFactory`
for an example.

## Getting Started

Typically, you wouldn't use this library and will use Dartastic OTel `dartastic_opentelemetry` 
or `flutterrific_opentelemetry` instead to  get a working OTel implementation in your 
Dart or Flutter application, respectively.  

### Installation

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  opentelemetry_api: ^0.8.0
```

Then run:

```bash
dart pub get
```

### Using with an SDK

This API is rarely used without an SDK. For a fully functional OpenTelemetry implementation, use one of the following:

- **Dart Backend Applications**: Use the [Dartastic OTel SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/dartastic_opentelemetry).
  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    dartastic_opentelemetry: ^1.0.0
  ```

- **Flutter Applications**: Use the [Flutterific OTel SDK](https://pub.dev/packages/flutterrific_opentelemetry).
  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    flutterrific_opentelemetry: ^1.0.0
  ```

### Direct API Usage (No-op Mode)

If you need a no-op OpenTelemetry implementation (unusual but compliant with the OTel spec):

```yaml
dependencies:
  opentelemetry_api: ^0.8.0
```

## Usage

The entrypoint for almost all object creation is the `OTelAPI` class. Again this would be rarely used, instead
use the `OTel` class from `dartastic_opentelemetry` which has the same methods with addition methods
for SDK objects like `Resource` and `SpanProcessor`.

All public constructors are private except the `OTelAPIFactory`.  Use the `OTelAPI` to create all API objects except
for `Tracer` and `Span`. The OTel specification requires that `TracerProviders` must provide a function for getting
a `Tracer` and that `Span`'s must only be created from a `Tracer`. Some immutable objects can also be created
by copy `with`, `copyWith` and `copyWithout` methods on those objects such as `Baggage`
`Baggage copyWith(String key, String value, [String? metadata])` and `Baggage copyWithout(String key)`.

In order to strictly comply with the limited types the OpenTelemetry specification allows
for `Attribute`s there's no generic `OTelAPI.attribute<T>` creation method and instead, to provide a
typesafe API, there are 8 creation methods for `String`, `bool`, `int`, `double` and `List`s of those types,
i.e. `OTelAPI.attributeString('foo', 'bar')`, `OTelAPI.attributeIntList('baz', [1, 2, 3])`.

The OTelAPI has additional "factory"-like methods, i.e. `baggageForMap(Map<String, String> keyValuePairs)`.


## Usage Examples

### Basic Tracing Example

```dart
import 'package:opentelemetry_api/opentelemetry_api.dart';

void main() {
  // Create a tracer
  final tracer = OTelAPI.tracerProvider().getTracer('example-service');
  
  // Create and use a span
  Span rootSpan = tracer.startSpan('main-operation');
  try {
    // Your business logic here
    rootSpan.setBoolAttribute('operation.success', true);
    
    // Create a child span for a sub-operation
    Span childSpan = tracer.startSpan('sub-operation');
    try {
      // Sub-operation logic
      childSpan.setIntAttribute('operation.value', 42);
    } finally {
      childSpan.end();
    }
  } catch (e, stackTrace) {
    // Record the error
    rootSpan
      ..setStatus(SpanStatusCode.error, e.toString())
      ..recordException(e, stackTrace: stackTrace);
    rethrow;
  } finally {
    rootSpan.setStatus(SpanStatusCode.Ok);
    // Always end the span
    rootSpan.end();
  }
}
```

### Using Context and Baggage

```dart
import 'package:opentelemetry_api/opentelemetry_api.dart';

void main() {
  // Create baggage with user info
  Baggage baggage = OTelAPI.baggageForMap({
    'userId': 'user-123',
    'tenant': 'example-tenant'
  });

  // Create a context with this baggage
  Context context = OTelAPI.context(baggage: baggage);
  
  // Make this the current context
  Context.current = context;
  
  // Later, retrieve baggage from current context
  Baggage currentBaggage = Baggage.fromContext(Context.current);
  String? userId = currentBaggage.getEntry('userId')?.value;
}
```

### Working with Attributes

```dart
import 'package:opentelemetry_api/opentelemetry_api.dart';

void main() {
  // Using the typesafe API methods
  Attributes attributes = OTelAPI.attributes([
    OTelAPI.attributeString('service.name', 'payment-processor'),
    OTelAPI.attributeInt('retry.count', 3),
    OTelAPI.attributeDouble('request.duration', 0.125),
    OTelAPI.attributeBool('request.success', true),
    OTelAPI.attributeStringList('tags', ['payment', 'critical']),
  ]);
  
  // Using Map extension
  Attributes fromMap = <String, Object>{
    'http.method': 'GET',
    'http.url': 'https://api.example.com/users',
    'http.status_code': 200,
    'environment': 'production',
    'user.roles': ['admin', 'operator'],
  }.toAttributes();
  
  // Example from original README
  Attributes equalToTheAbove = Attributes.of({
    'example_string_key': 'foo',
    'example_double_key': 42.1,
    'example_bool_list_key': [true, false, true],
    'example_int_list_key': [42, 43, 44],
  });
}
```

## API Overview

### Main API Components

- **OTelAPI** - The main entry point for creating API objects
- **Tracer** - Creates spans for tracing operations
- **Span** - Represents a unit of work or operation
- **Context** - Carries execution metadata across API boundaries
- **Baggage** - Provides a mechanism to propagate key-value pairs alongside a context
- **Attributes** - Represent keyvalue pairs with a known set of value types

### Important OTelAPI Methods

The entrypoint for almost all object creation is the `OTelAPI` class. 
In real applications, you would typically use the `OTel` class from an SDK implementation.

```dart
// Get the tracer provider
TracerProvider provider = OTelAPI.tracerProvider();

// Create context
Context context = OTelAPI.context(baggage: baggage, spanContext: spanContext);

// Create attributes
Attribute attr1 = OTelAPI.attributeString('key', 'value');
Attribute attr2 = OTelAPI.attributeInt('count', 42);
Attributes attributes = OTelAPI.attributes([attr1, attr2]);

// Create baggage
Baggage baggage = OTelAPI.baggageForMap({'userId': 'user-123'});
```

## Usage Patterns

All public constructors are private except the `OTelAPIFactory`. Use the `OTelAPI` to create all API objects except for `Tracer` and `Span`. The OTel specification requires that `TracerProviders` must provide a function for getting a `Tracer` and that `Span`'s must only be created from a `Tracer`. Some immutable objects can also be created by copy `with`, `copyWith` and `copyWithout` methods on those objects such as `Baggage` `Baggage copyWith(String key, String value, [String? metadata])` and `Baggage copyWithout(String key)`.

In order to strictly comply with the limited types the OpenTelemetry specification allows for `Attribute`s there's no generic `OTelAPI.attribute<T>` creation method and instead, to provide a typesafe API, there are 8 creation methods for `String`, `bool`, `int`, `double` and `List`s of those types, i.e. `OTelAPI.attributeString('foo', 'bar')`, `OTelAPI.attributeIntList('baz', [1, 2, 3])`.
