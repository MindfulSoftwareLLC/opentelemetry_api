# OpenTelemetry API for Dart Public Availability Plan

This plan outlines the steps needed to make the OpenTelemetry API available for Dart both on pub.dev and as a CNCF contribution. 

## 1. Package Structure and Documentation

### 1.1 Essential Documentation
- [x] Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines for contributors
- [x] Add a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file (use the CNCF Code of Conduct)
- [x] Update README.md to include:
  - Clear project description
  - Getting started guide
  - API reference summary
  - Examples of different use cases
  - Compatibility with other OpenTelemetry implementations
  - Roadmap/future plans
- [ ] Create a comprehensive API documentation with dartdoc comments
- [x] Add a NOTICE file to acknowledge contributions and dependencies

### 1.2 Package Structure Improvements
- [ ] Ensure file structure follows Dart conventions
- [ ] Review and organize exports in main library file
- [ ] Create example directories for different use cases (basic, web, advanced)

## 2. Pub.dev Score Optimization

### 2.1 Package Health Analysis
- [x] Run `dart pub publish --dry-run` to identify any issues
- [ ] Run `pana` tool to analyze the package and follow recommendations
- [ ] Ensure all URLs are valid and use HTTPS scheme
- [x] Format CHANGELOG.md according to pub.dev conventions

### 2.2 Coding Standards
- [ ] Ensure all linting rules are followed
- [ ] Run `dart analyze` to fix any warnings or issues
- [x] Add additional analyzer options for stricter code quality
- [ ] Fix any formatting issues with `dart format`

### 2.3 Test Coverage
- [ ] Achieve and maintain high test coverage (target: >90%)
- [ ] Add integration tests for all key APIs
- [ ] Include example tests to demonstrate proper API usage
- [ ] Add performance benchmark tests

## 3. OpenTelemetry Specification Compliance

### 3.1 Specification Alignment
- [ ] Review the latest OpenTelemetry specification
- [ ] Map each specification requirement to implementation
- [ ] Document any deviations and the reasons for them
- [ ] Ensure semantic conventions are followed strictly

### 3.2 Interoperability Testing
- [ ] Create interoperability tests with other language implementations
- [ ] Test cross-platform propagation (headers, context)
- [ ] Verify protocol compatibility with OpenTelemetry Collector

## 4. Community and Contribution Readiness

### 4.1 Community Support
- [x] Create issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- [x] Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and releases
- [x] Document governance model for the project
- [x] Define security disclosure process

### 4.2 CNCF Specific Requirements
- [x] Ensure license compatibility (Apache 2.0)
- [x] Create GOVERNANCE.md file outlining project governance
- [ ] Prepare for CNCF due diligence review
- [ ] Document alignment with OpenTelemetry project goals

## 5. Additional Features and Enhancements

### 5.1 API Completeness
- [ ] Implement any missing required API components
- [ ] Support all attribute types specified in OpenTelemetry
- [ ] Ensure context propagation mechanisms are complete
- [ ] Add support for all required format conversions

### 5.2 Platform Support
- [ ] Verify compatibility with all Dart platforms:
  - Native (VM)
  - Web (JS)
  - Flutter (Android/iOS)
- [ ] Document platform-specific considerations

### 5.3 Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Conduct performance benchmarks
- [ ] Optimize critical code paths
- [ ] Minimize allocation and garbage collection
- [ ] Ensure efficient async operations

## 6. Release and Publication Strategy

### 6.1 Version Strategy
- [x] Define versioning strategy aligned with OpenTelemetry releases
- [x] Document stability guarantees for each API component
- [ ] Create a roadmap for future versions

### 6.2 Publication Process
- [x] Create a publication checklist
- [x] Document release process
- [ ] Plan for announcement and community engagement

## Timeline and Priority

This plan should be executed in the following order of priority:

1. **Critical for Publication (Days 1-7)**
   - Essential documentation updates
   - Package health analysis and fixes
   - Specification alignment verification

2. **Important for Adoption (Days 8-14)**
   - API completeness review and implementation
   - Test coverage improvements
   - Platform support verification

3. **Community Building (Days 15-21)**
   - Community support infrastructure
   - CNCF specific preparations
   - Release strategy documentation

4. **Optimization (Days 22-30)**
   - Performance optimizations
   - Additional examples and documentation
   - Interoperability testing

## Success Metrics

- Pub.dev score of 100+ points
- Test coverage > 90%
- Complete documentation with examples
- Full OpenTelemetry specification compliance
- Successful interoperability with other implementations
- Positive community feedback
- CNCF acceptance
