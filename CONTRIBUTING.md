## Getting Started

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/opentelemetry_api.git
   cd opentelemetry_api
   ```
3. Add the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/MindfulSoftwareLLC/opentelemetry_api.git
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   dart pub get
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes
3. Run tests to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   dart test
   ```
4. Run the analyzer:
   ```bash
   dart analyze
   ```
5. Format your code:
   ```bash
   dart format .
   ```
6. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```
7. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
8. Create a pull request to the main repository

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md or other documentation with details of changes if appropriate
2. Update the CHANGELOG.md with a description of your changes
3. The PR should work with the latest version of Dart and be compatible with all supported platforms
4. The PR will be merged once it receives approval from project maintainers

## Coding Standards

### Code Style

This project follows the official [Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style) and uses the standard Dart formatting tool (`dart format`).

### Linting Rules

We use the recommended Dart linting rules. Always run `dart analyze` before submitting a PR to ensure your code follows these rules.

### Testing

All new code should be covered by tests. We use the `test` package for writing and running tests.

- All tests should be in the `test` directory
- Test files should end with `_test.dart`
- Run tests with `dart test`

### Documentation

- All public APIs must have dartdoc comments
- Comments should explain "why" not just "what"
- Example usage is encouraged for complex functionality

## Specification Compliance

Since this project implements the OpenTelemetry API specification:

1. All implementations must strictly follow the [OpenTelemetry specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/)
2. Any deviations from the specification must be clearly documented and justified
3. Follow the semantic conventions defined by OpenTelemetry

## Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages that explain the changes you've made. Follow these guidelines:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

## Issue Process

### Reporting Bugs

When reporting bugs, please include:

- A clear, descriptive title
- A detailed description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce the problem
- Expected behavior and actual behavior
- Your environment (Dart version, platform, etc.)
- If possible, a minimal code example that demonstrates the issue

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. Please provide:

- A clear, descriptive title
- A detailed description of the proposed feature
- An explanation of why this feature would be useful
- Example use cases
- If possible, outline how the feature might be implemented

## Release Process

The release process is handled by project maintainers. If you're a maintainer, follow these steps:

1. Update version in `pubspec.yaml`
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with all changes since the last release
3. Create a release commit
4. Tag the release commit with the version number (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
5. Push the commit and tag to the repository
6. Publish to pub.dev:
   ```bash
   dart pub publish
   ```
