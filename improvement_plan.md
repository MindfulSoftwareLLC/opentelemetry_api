# OpenTelemetry API for Dart Improvement Plan

This plan outlines the steps needed to maximize the chances of acceptance and success for the OpenTelemetry API for Dart both on pub.dev and as a CNCF contribution. The plan is divided into sections focusing on different aspects of the project.

## 1. Package Structure and Documentation

### 1.1 Essential Documentation
- [ ] Create a CONTRIBUTING.md file with guidelines for contributors
- [ ] Add a CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md file (use the CNCF Code of Conduct)
- [ ] Update README.md to include:
  - Clear project description
  - Getting started guide
  - API reference summary
  - Examples of different use cases
  - Compatibility with other OpenTelemetry implementations
  - Roadmap/future plans
- [ ] Create a comprehensive API documentation with dartdoc comments
- [ ] Add a NOTICE file to acknowledge contributions and dependencies

### 1.2 Package Structure Improvements
- [ ] Ensure file structure follows Dart conventions
- [ ] Review and organize exports in main library file
- [ ] Create example directories for different use cases (basic, web, advanced)

## 2. Pub.dev Score Optimization

### 2.1 Package Health Analysis
- [ ] Run `dart pub publish --dry-run` to identify any issues
- [ ] Run `pana` tool to analyze the package and follow recommendations
- [ ] Ensure all URLs are valid and use HTTPS scheme
- [ ] Format CHANGELOG.md according to pub.dev conventions

### 2.2 Coding Standards
- [ ] Ensure all linting rules are followed
- [ ] Run `dart analyze` to fix any warnings or issues
- [ ] Add additional analyzer options for stricter code quality
- [ ] Fix any formatting issues with `dart format`

### 2.3 Test Coverage
- [ ] Achieve and maintain high test coverage (target: >90%)
- [ ] Add integration tests for all key APIs
- [ ] Include example tests to demonstrate proper API usage
- [ ] Add performance benchmark tests

## 3. OpenTelemetry Specification Compliance

### 3.1 Specification Alignment
- [ ] Review the latest OpenTelemetry specification
- [ ] Map each specification requirement to implementation
- [ ] Document any deviations and the reasons for them
- [ ] Ensure semantic conventions are followed strictly

### 3.2 Interoperability Testing
- [ ] Create interoperability tests with other language implementations
- [ ] Test cross-platform propagation (headers, context)
- [ ] Verify protocol compatibility with OpenTelemetry Collector

## 4. Community and Contribution Readiness

### 4.1 Community Support
- [ ] Create issue templates for bug reports and feature requests
- [ ] Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and releases
- [ ] Document governance model for the project
- [ ] Define security disclosure process

### 4.2 CNCF Specific Requirements
- [ ] Ensure license compatibility (Apache 2.0)
- [ ] Create GOVERNANCE.md file outlining project governance
- [ ] Prepare for CNCF due diligence review
- [ ] Document alignment with OpenTelemetry project goals

## 5. Additional Features and Enhancements

### 5.1 API Completeness
- [ ] Implement any missing required API components
- [ ] Support all attribute types specified in OpenTelemetry
- [ ] Ensure context propagation mechanisms are complete
- [ ] Add support for all required format conversions

### 5.2 Platform Support
- [ ] Verify compatibility with all Dart platforms:
  - Native (VM)
  - Web (JS)
  - Flutter (Android/iOS)
- [ ] Document platform-specific considerations

### 5.3 Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Conduct performance benchmarks
- [ ] Optimize critical code paths
- [ ] Minimize allocation and garbage collection
- [ ] Ensure efficient async operations

## 6. Release and Publication Strategy

### 6.1 Version Strategy
- [ ] Define versioning strategy aligned with OpenTelemetry releases
- [ ] Document stability guarantees for each API component
- [ ] Create a roadmap for future versions

### 6.2 Publication Process
- [ ] Create a publication checklist
- [ ] Document release process
- [ ] Plan for announcement and community engagement

## Timeline and Priority

This plan should be executed in the following order of priority:

1. **Critical for Publication (Days 1-7)**
   - Essential documentation updates
   - Package health analysis and fixes
   - Specification alignment verification

2. **Important for Adoption (Days 8-14)**
   - API completeness review and implementation
   - Test coverage improvements
   - Platform support verification

3. **Community Building (Days 15-21)**
   - Community support infrastructure
   - CNCF specific preparations
   - Release strategy documentation

4. **Optimization (Days 22-30)**
   - Performance optimizations
   - Additional examples and documentation
   - Interoperability testing

## Success Metrics

- Pub.dev score of 100+ points
- Test coverage > 90%
- Complete documentation with examples
- Full OpenTelemetry specification compliance
- Successful interoperability with other implementations
- Positive community feedback
- CNCF acceptance
